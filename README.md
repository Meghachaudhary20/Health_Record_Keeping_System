# Health_Record_Keeping_System
The Personal Health Record Management Website project aims to develop a secure and user-friendly platform that allows individuals to store, manage, and access their health records and related information conveniently. This platform will empower users to take control of their health data, enabling them to make informed decisions about their well-being and share relevant information with healthcare providers as needed.
